# UMLsec4NDF
With the increasing reliance on e-commerce systems, security threats such as the Ping of Death (PoD) pose significant risks. As part of this master's thesis, we develop a customized extension of the UMLsec profile, named UMLsec4NDF (Network Defense Framework), which enhances this profile, to better support modeling and mitigation PoD attack, which will be used in modeling and analyzing the security violation referred to as the PoD attack on e-commerce systems.
The system architecture under analysis consists of a network router, cloud server, Industrial Control System (ICS) firewall, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) The PoD attack consists of sending oversized or malformed Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets with the intent of compromising the target systems and making them crash or reboot due to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
The objective of the study is to contribute to the knowledge about the use of model driven engineering approaches for evaluating and addressing security concerns within complex e-commerce systems. The research integrates UML with UMLsec and UMLsec4NDF stereotypes for security analysis.
